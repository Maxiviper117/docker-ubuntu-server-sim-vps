# Instructions for Creating Git Branches

- Use descriptive branch names with a prefix indicating the type of work (e.g., `feature/login-page`, `bugfix/issue-123`, `hotfix/critical-bug`).
- Keep branches small and focused on a single feature, bug fix, or task.
- Create branches from the main branch (e.g., `main` or `develop`) unless otherwise specified by the project workflow.
- Use lowercase letters and hyphens to separate words in branch names (e.g., `feature/add-user-auth`).
- Avoid using special characters or spaces in branch names.
- Regularly merge or rebase with the main branch to stay updated and minimize merge conflicts.
- Delete branches after they are merged into the main branch, unless they are long-lived (e.g., `main`, `develop`).
