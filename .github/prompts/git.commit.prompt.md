# Instructions for Git Commit Messages

- Use the imperative mood in the subject line (e.g., "Fix bug" instead of "Fixed bug").
- Use prefixes to categorize commits (e.g., `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `style:`, `refactor:`, `test:`, `chore:`).
- Keep the subject line concise, ideally under 50 characters, and provide a detailed description in the body if needed.
- Include a body for complex changes, explaining *what* was changed and *why* (not *how*).
- Reference issue or ticket numbers if applicable (e.g., "Closes #123").
- Write clear, atomic commits that address a single change or feature.
- Run tests and linters before committing to ensure code quality.
